This is an interactive installation for shoppers taking a snapshot and transforming it into a stylish video.

The client wanted his shopers look and feel like trendy fashion lovers during their shopping experiences. So this installation providing such function for them.

The original idea for the system was included two main parts [Photo Booth](#photo_booth) and [Video Processing & Display](#video_prces). These two parts were connected to a router and communicating each other through [HTTP][ref_http].
